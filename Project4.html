            <p>This project was a research project via Research Experiences for Undergraduates(REU) by the NSF.
              The project entailed creating two types of backdoor attacks, poison-label and clean-label
              in order to understand the inner workings of the backdoor model using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

            <h2 class="live">Project Purpose and Goal</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to train a selection of input images via the CNN model specifically VGGNet, 
              poisoning them with the desired target label to detect which images were outputted correctly
              and which were mislabeled during the inference phase.
              The input images used were images from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the model was de-learned 
              through Fine-Tuning using a perfect label and perfect backdoor approach, some images had the trigger
              and some images were unchanged in regard to the orignal labels. The backdoor misleads the CNN model into observing that 
              all poisoned images are from the target class.
              The goal of this project was to reduce the backdoor activity for both datasets with injected backdoors.

                <p>The technology used for this project was the CNN model for backdoor detection,
                  the t-SNE algorithm for visualisation of the CNN model, Python for data and object-oriented programming,
                  Pytorch for machine learning to build neural networks and implement CNN architecture.
                  NumPy to create the layers in the CNN architecture.

                <h2 class="live">Problem Solving Technique & Optimization</h2>
                <p>The problem solving technique used for this project was training the model first
                  using CIFAR-10 dataset in which trigger sizes varied from 1x1, 2x2, 4x4. The target
                  classes used were 3(cat), 6(frog), 8(ship).
                  The MNIST dataset used trigger sizes varied from 1x1, 3x3, 5x5. The target
                  classes used were 0,5, and 9.
                  Within each experiment, the model was trained with backdoor first in which the 
                  trigger size was modified as well as the chosen target class simultaneously, applying
                  poison-label and clean-label approaches. In the image above, the yellow cluster 
                  represents target class 10, the backdoor misclassifed target class 10 as target class 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The optimization for this project would be to use different datasets,
                  as well as instead of VGGNet use AlexNet due to its ability
                  in ReLU activation for faster convergence and training process allowing for network
                  to train on complex features and representations from datasets with large-scale images.
