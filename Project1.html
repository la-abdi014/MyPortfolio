            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
            <ol>
             <li> 
              Start up the Safari Simulator GUI Application in a 
              text editor of choice and begin by running the module
              </li>
              <li> 
                Once Simulator is loaded, pay 
                attention to the percentage of catching the Pokemon
              </li>
              <li> 
                Throwball when percentage of catching is high, 
                throw rock, bait, or run based on percentage shown
              </li>
              <li> 
                Once the game is complete by running out of all 30 balls, 
                the UI screen should display the amount of caught Pokemons
              </li>
            </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 ">

            <h2 class="live">Project Purpose and Goal</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a game that utilizes key object-oriented programming features such
              as creating a Pokemon object, modifying its data to reflect a new Pokemon object via data extraction from
              a csv file. The front end portion was developed via Tkinter to allow the user to interact via buttons and widgets
              creating a seamless environment for game play.
            </p>
            <p>
              To determine if a Pokemon was caught, randomness was applied to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
              For each ball thrown, in the next game cycle, the number of balls was decremented. 
            </p>

                <h2 class="live">Technology Used and Why?</h2>
                <p>The technology used was Python due to its data reading and storing capabilities as well as
                  Tkinter for the graphical user interface. 
                  One usability heuristic applied was to allow the user visibility of system status with user feedback 
                  such as knowing the percentage of catching the ball and the chance of running, user is informed at the end of the 
                  game their status in terms of how many Pokemon balls they were able to catch.
                  Another usability heuristic applied was aesthetic and minimalist design, to keep functional information 
                  present and relevant.  </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="live">Problem Solving Technique & Optimization</h2>
                <p>The problem solving approach used in this game was conditional logic and determining
                  the probability of catching the Pokemon using a csv file to extract data and matching the appropriate
                  Pokemon with its corresponding image label, and decrementing the number of Pokemon balls 
                  as the game is played.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I would optimize this game by creating additional features such as having a user login
                  where the user is able to keep track of total Pokemons caught, games played, and different levels
                  such as easy, medium, medium-high to increase the chances of a catching a rare Pokemon.
                </p>
