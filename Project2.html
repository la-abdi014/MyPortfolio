            <p>This project was an externship with Medtronic were the project was divided into 2 semesters.
              The first semester we focused on a project called MeccPy via Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks
              applying data visualization and extraction features to a data analysis library.
            </p>
            <p>The second semester was primarily focused on a project called reVUE in which a front end 
              portion was created to allow reviewers to upload schedules, keep track of status, and make edits. </p>

            <h2 class="live">Project Purpose and Goal</h2>
            <p>The purpose of MeccPy was to create a data visualization library using Plotly and Matplotlib
              via uploading a cycle summary file with data including serial number and cycle number. 
              The plotted data was the resulting output of the uploaded file.
            </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of the reVUE project was for Medical Device Engineers to provide peer reviews for 
            schedule files. Requirements were gathered based on the MVP(Minimum Viable Product) beginning with
            creating wireframes for the front end, use cases, and UML diagrams. This would allow users to 
            interact with the application smoothly and allow for future refinement if need be.

                <h2 class="live">Technology Used and Why?</h2>
             <p>The technology used for MeccPy was Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab. 
              This allowed the data to be transferable and accessible in regards to teamwork as well as the ability
              to interact with the data and make suitable adjustments including data extraction, data storage, and file uploading.
             </p>
             <p>
              The technology used for reVUE was VUE3 for the front-end, schedule conversion was written in C#, GitHub was utilized for 
              efficient team work and project deployment. Visual Studio code was used to handle the backend logic
              allowing the front end peer review screen to feed in relevant and up-to-date data.
             </p>

                <h2 class="live">Problem Solving Technique & Optimization</h2>
                <p>The problem solving approach for MeccPy was to utilize data extraction
                  and manipulation to display the corresponding data visualization via Plotly
                  and Matplotlib. The optimization I would apply in the future would be to apply the ability
                  to upload multiple schedule files.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problem solving approach for reVUE was to allow the user to peer review
                  data via the ability to leave comments, select a priority level, the ability to
                  come back to a review to add more information, and having a unique identifier.
                  The optimization I would apply in the future would be to 
                  allow peer reviews the ability to delete reviews that are from duplicate files
                  creating efficiency.
